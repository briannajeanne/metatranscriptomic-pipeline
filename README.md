# Multi-Script Data Processing Workflow

This shell script is designed to process multiple sets of paired-end sequencing data using a series of scripts. The scripts included in this workflow handle tasks such as splitting, trimming, counting, and summarizing taxonomic information. The workflow is designed to work with a tab-delimited manifest file containing information about the input data, specifically the paths to the R1 and R2 fastq files, a prefix for output files, and a batch identifier.

## Prerequisites
- The following scripts must be available in the specified paths:
  - `nothmodifying_split_trim.sh`
  - `fq_count.sh`
  - `kraken_summary_levels.sh`
  - `kraken_summary_taxID.sh`
- Ensure that the necessary conda environment (`krsummary_workspace1`) is created and activated before running the script. You can uncomment the provided conda commands if needed.

## Usage
```bash
./manifesting2_wd.sh <manifest_file> <working_directory>
```
- `<manifest_file>`: Path to the tab-delimited manifest file with columns R1, R2, prefix, and batch.
- `<working_directory>`: Directory where the data processing will take place.

## Scripts
- **nothmodifying_split_trim.sh**: Splits and trims paired-end sequencing data.
- **fq_count.sh**: Counts the number of reads in fastq files.
- **kraken_summary_levels.sh**: Generates a summary of taxonomic information at different levels using Kraken.
- **kraken_summary_taxID.sh**: Generates a summary of taxonomic information based on taxonomic IDs using Kraken.

## Workflow Execution
1. Activate the conda environment (`krsummary_workspace1`).
2. Execute the specified scripts for each entry in the manifest file.
3. Perform additional steps like running FastQC on the processed data and compressing fastq files.
4. Deactivate the conda environment.

## Manifest File Format
The manifest file should be tab-delimited and contain the following columns:
- **R1**: Path to the R1 fastq file.
- **R2**: Path to the R2 fastq file.
- **prefix**: Prefix for output files.
- **batch**: Identifier for the batch.

## Example
```bash
./manifesting2_wd.sh my_manifest.txt /path/to/working/directory
```

## Notes
- Review the scripts in the workflow to ensure they meet the requirements of your specific data processing needs.
- Verify that the specified conda environment is correctly set up with the required dependencies.
